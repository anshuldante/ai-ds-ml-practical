## TODO

* Linear discriminant analysis
* Principal Component Analysis
* Adaboost
* XGBoost
* Light GBS
* Cat Boost
* Bagging
* Confusion matrix
* Build the samples from **advanced-predictive-modeling-mastering-ensembles-and-metamodeling**

## Notes

* We can use correlations to fill in the missing values
